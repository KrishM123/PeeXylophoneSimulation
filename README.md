# Pee Xylophone Simulation
This simulation was used to verify my f(V2) function in Phase 2.

This simulation works by using the inputted initial velocity, initial angle and initial height to model the path of the projectile and find it's impact velocity and range.

It then uses the impact velocity and range values in f(V2) and applies newton's method to work backwords to calculate initial velocity.

If the calculated initial velocity is similar to the inputted initial velocity, then the function is correct.

NOTE: Use the printed impact velocity and range values in the desmos graph of f(V2) to view the f(V2) graph created.
